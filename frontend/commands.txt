Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd frontend
  npm start

Happy hacking!

- I am very much a beginner at git. I set up the site's repository at https://github.com/luivader/contact-manager. I don't know a proper workflow for collaboration but I wanted to at least test one way we could all work on stuff. This seems to work, but I've never used git collaboratively. If any of you have, and this is super wrong, we should definitely change it
new users (do once):
  git clone https://github.com/luivader/contact-manager.git
  cd contact-manager
  git add -A 
  git commit -m "message" 
  git push -u origin main (probably need to authenticate?)

subsequent workflow (in the contact-manager directory, the one with the .git):
  git pull origin main 
  git add -A 
  git commit -m "message" 
  git push -u origin main

to publish to the live site, on remote machine (inside of  /var/www/):
  git pull origin main
